## üì¶ Installation

**Via github**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hollfelder-Lab/lrDMS-IRED.git
cd lrDMS-IRED
pip install .
```

## üöÄ Usage

### UMIC-seq2 raw data processing
The pipeline scripts for processing the raw UMIC-seq2 data detailed in [`scripts`](scripts). The output of the processing pipeline is a `.csv` file containing the fitness scores for individual sequences. For convenience, the processed data is also provided in the [`data`](data) folder as `srired_active_data.csv`. The pipeline is adapted from [![Zurek et al 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19687-9) to allow for (i) the processing of larger datasets via use of mmseqs2 for clustering and (ii) incorporation of the UMI sequence in polished reads for use in long-read deep mutational scanning. 

### Epistasis Graph Analysis

The easiest way to run the scripts is via Google Colab. The Jupyter notebook Epistasis_analysis.ipynb can directly be opened on Colab by pressing the following Open in Colab button:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Hollfelder-Lab/lrDMS-IRED/blob/main/notebooks/Epistasis_analysis.ipynb)

After having opened the notebook in Colab, the python scripts `analysis_utils.py` and `plotting_utils.py` from the src folder need to be uploaded. These scripts contain the core functions for the analyses and plots to be carried out. Also, the csv file `srired_active_data.csv` from the data folder containing the DMS data along side the distance matrix npy file `min_dimer_distances.npy` must be uploaded
